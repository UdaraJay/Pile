## Why use Pile?

- 💾 **Local Storage**: Keep your journal entries stored securely on your computer, offering you greater flexibility and ownership.
- 📝 **Markdown Support**: Entries are stored as markdown files (*currently includes some HTML), keeping your journal clean and accessible with tools other than Pile.
- 🗂️ **Create Piles**: Organize your thoughts by creating separate *Piles* for different aspects of your day-to-day life, _or_ use one Pile as a general journal for everything.

## Getting started

1. ⬇️ Download the latest version of Pile by going to the [Pile releases page](https://github.com/UdaraJay/Pile/releases/).
2. 📂 Open the `.zip` or `.dmg` file and drag the application to the destination of your choice (*optional*), such as your `Applications/` folder.
3. 📝 Finally open the application, create a `New Pile`, and start your reflective journey.

### AI reflections (requires GPT-4 access)

Enhance your journaling experience by integrating OpenAI's GPT AI reflections into Pile. If you have access to OpenAI's GPT-4 API, you can use your API key to:

- **Reflect on text**: Click "reflect" on any written text to get AI-generated insights and thoughts.

👉 To do this, head over to [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and create a new API key. Click the settings icon on the top-right corner of Pile and enter your secret API key into the API key field.
