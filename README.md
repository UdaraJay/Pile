Pile is a desktop app for reflective journaling. It's about simplicity, keeping your data local, and enhancing your journaling experience with AI.

## Getting started

1. Download the latest version of Pile by going to the [Pile releases page](https://github.com/UdaraJay/Pile/releases/).
2. Open the `.zip` or `.dmg` file and drag the application to the destination of your choice (_optional_), such as your `Applications/` folder.
3. Finally open the application, create a `New Pile`, and start your reflective journey.

### AI reflections (requires GPT-4 access)

Enhance your journaling experience by integrating OpenAI's GPT AI reflections into Pile. If you have access to OpenAI's GPT-4 API, you can use your API key to:

- **Reflect on entries**: Click "reflect" on any written entry to get AI-generated insights and thoughts as a reply in the thread.
- **Search or ask questions**: Click the "reflect" icon on the top-right of the window to search or ask question about your entire journal.

To setup the AI features: head over to [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and create a new API key. Click the settings icon on the top-right corner of Pile and enter your secret API key into the API key field. 

Before you use the AI-powered features within this app, we strongly recommend that you [configure a spending limit within OpenAI's interface](https://platform.openai.com/account/limits) to prevent unexpected costs.
